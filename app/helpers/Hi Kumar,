Hi Kumar,

It was a pleasure meeting you today! Attached is the code sample for the prefix question you asked at the end. You are one of the most ambitious CTOs I've ever spoken to in my interviews. Your confidence in SumoLogic as the "next thing" is contagious. I would be more than excited to join SumoLogic to make a splash in the next big-data with intelligence revolution. However, I personally think I definitely did not do my best in some of the rounds of interview today and unnaturally stumbled on the easy problems such as "compress aaabbbb to 3a4b". I just had that problem two days ago with another interviewer and today I had a mental block with my own code. If I were the interviewer I don't think I would have made my own interview. 

That being said, I definitely had fun talking to each of the team. Whatever the result, I wish you the best of luck with your company. :)

Thank you for interviewing me again, ;)
Perry
